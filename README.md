# opengl_scene

Scene created in OpenGL based on Gordon's book Computer Graphics Programming in OpenGL with JAVA Second Edition. 

All objects were made by me in blender.

All object textures were made by me in blender and edited in photoshop.

SkyBox texture was obtained from:
Gordon, V. Scott; Clevenger, John. Computer Graphics Programming in OpenGL with JAVA Second Edition. Mercury Learning and Information.

Controls:

w- forward

a-left 

s-down 

d-right 

q-up 

e-down 

up key – look up 

left key – look left 

down key – look down 

right key – look right space bar- show/hide axis 

space bar- show/hide axis


The light controls are not linked to the camera i.e. the movement of the light will always be the 
same no matter what angle the user is looking at. (make sure to have clicked on the window before dragging)

mouse drag (click and hold)– moves the light in the x y axis. up and down for y axis and left to right 

scroll wheel – moves the light in the z axis where scroll up is negative z axis and scroll down is positive z axis. 

g – turn on or off positional lighting.
